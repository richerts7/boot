Basics & Push(upload) code to remote repositories :

git init                                    -> intialises empty local repo 
git add file_name                           -> adds files to local repo 
git status                                  -> used to check the status of the local repo 
git commit -m "message"                     -> used to commit changes 
git remote add <alias_name>  <repo_url>     -> connects remote repo with local repo 
git push -u <alias_name> <branch_name>      -> used to push a local branch to remote repo 

Pull(download) code from remote repositories : 

git pull <alias_name>                   -> fetches the changes made in server and 
                                           merges with the corresponding branch in local repository
git fetch <alias_name>                  -> Just downloads the changes made in remote repo 
git merge <alias_name> /<branch_name>   -> merges the downloaded changes with the local branch 
git clone <repo_url>                    -> clones(downloads) the remote repository 

Branching :

git branch (or) git branch --list       -> used to display the list of branches in current local repo 
git branch <branch_name>                -> creates a brach with a branch name of <branch_name> 
git checkout <branch_name>              -> changes the branch from current branch to <branch_name>
git branch -M <new_name>                -> changes the current branch name to <new_name>
git branch -d <brach_name>              -> safe delete branch 
git branch -D <branch_name>             -> Force delete branch 
git checkout -b <branch_name>           -> creates and checks out to <branch_name>
